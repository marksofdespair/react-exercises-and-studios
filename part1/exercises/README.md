Getting Started with Vite

To get started we first need to install `vite` within the project directory.

```console
npm create vite@latest
```

You will be asked to provide a name for the project.

You will then select `React` from the available options.

You will then need to select the `JavaScript` variant.

Now that your project has scaffolded you can navigate into the project root directory and run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm run dev
```

You can view some useful Shortcuts if you press `h`

At this point you can either open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` or press `o` if you are within the terminal window running the application.
